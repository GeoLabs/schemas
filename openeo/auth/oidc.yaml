                  The [issuer location](https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-discovery-1_0.html#ProviderConfig)
                  (also referred to as 'authority' in some client libraries) is the URL of the
                  OpenID Connect provider, which conforms to a set of rules:

                  1. After appending `/.well-known/openid-configuration` to the URL, a
                  [HTTP/1.1 GET
                  request](https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-discovery-1_0.html#ProviderConfigurationRequest)
                  to the concatenated URL MUST return a [OpenID Connect Discovery Configuration
                  Response](https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-discovery-1_0.html#ProviderConfigurationResponse).
                  The response provides all information required to authenticate using
                  OpenID Connect.

                  2. The URL MUST NOT contain a terminating forward slash `/`.

                example: 'https://accounts.google.com'
              scopes:
                type: array
                description: >-
                  A list of OpenID Connect scopes that the client MUST at least include when requesting authorization.
                  Clients MAY add additional scopes such as the `offline_access` scope to retrieve a refresh token.

                  If scopes are specified, the list MUST at least contain the `openid` scope.

                  It should make clear how to register and get credentials. This should
                  include instruction on setting up `client_id`, `client_secret` and `redirect_uri`.

                  List of default OpenID Connect clients that can be used by an openEO client
                  for OpenID Connect based authentication.

                  A default OpenID Connect client is managed by the back-end implementer.
                  It MUST be configured to be usable without a client secret,
                  which limits its applicability to OpenID Connect grant types like
                  "Authorization Code Grant with PKCE" and "Device Authorization Grant with PKCE"

                  A default OpenID Connect client is provided without availability guarantees.
                  The back-end implementer CAN revoke, reset or update it any time.
                  As such, openEO clients SHOULD NOT store or cache default OpenID Connect client information
                  for long term usage.
                  A default OpenID Connect client is intended to simplify authentication for novice users.
                  For production use cases, it is RECOMMENDED to set up a dedicated OpenID Connect client.

                        List of authorization grant types (flows) supported by the OpenID Connect client.
                        A grant type descriptor consist of a OAuth 2.0 grant type,
                        with an additional `+pkce` suffix when the grant type should be used with
                        the PKCE extension as defined in [RFC 7636](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc7636.html).

                        Allowed values:

                        - `authorization_code` / `authorization_code+pkce`: Authorization Code Grant as specified in [RFC 6749, sec. 1.3.1](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc6749.html#section-1.3.1), with or without PKCE extension.
                        - `urn:ietf:params:oauth:grant-type:device_code` / `urn:ietf:params:oauth:grant-type:device_code+pkce`: Device Authorization Grant (aka Device Code Flow) as specified in [RFC 8628](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc8628.html), with or without PKCE extension. Note that the combination of this grant with the PKCE extension is *not standardized* yet.
                        - `refresh_token`: Refresh Token as specified in [RFC 6749, sec. 1.5](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc6749.html#section-1.5)
